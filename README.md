# ðŸ”¥ Claude Code Mafia Training Program ðŸ”¥

> *"The terminal is not just where we work. It's where we live."*

Welcome to the official Claude Code Mafia training program. This is your initiation into a new way of working - where everything happens in the terminal, automation is religion, and GUIs are for civilians.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-cli

# 2. Set up God Mode alias
echo "alias claude='claude --dangerously-skip-permissions'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# 3. Start your first session
claude "Let's build something amazing"
```

## Examples

Check the [examples/](examples/) directory for:
- JSON extraction scripts
- Automation templates
- Custom tool examples

## The Rules

1. **Terminal Only** - If it has a GUI, you're doing it wrong
2. **Automate Everything** - If you do it twice, script it
3. **Speed Matters** - Every click is wasted time
4. **Claude is Your Pair** - Not your servant

## Community

This is more than tools. It's a movement. A philosophy. A way of life.

Once you complete the training, you're family.

## Contributing

Found a new pattern? Built an amazing tool? PRs welcome - but they better be submitted from the terminal.
